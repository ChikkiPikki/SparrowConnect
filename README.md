# SparrowConnect
The secret project Sergey Brin would be excited about
I have just begin my journey on GutHub, so let me implement a few lines of code in java

Class Sparrow{

public static void main(String Args[])
{
  int a[] = new int[20];
  
  for(i=1;i<40;i++)
  {
    i%3 == k;
    if(k%2 ==0)
    a[i] = k;
  System.out.println();
  }
}
}
